</p>

This repository contains the solutions to the in-class labs for the **CS2023 - Data Structures and Algorithms** course. The code for each problem is written in **C++** and is organized by weekly assignments. 



## Topics Covered
Here is a list of the topics covered in the in-class labs:

1. **Introduction to C++ Programming**
2. **Arrays and Strings**
3. **Sorting Algorithms (Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)**
4. **Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)**
5. **Stacks and Queues**
6. **Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly Linked Lists)**
7. **Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)**
8. **Graphs (BFS, DFS)**
9. **Heaps and Priority Queues**
10. **Hashing**
11. **Dynamic Programming**

Each folder in this repository represents a week of the course, where you'll find the C++ implementation of the corresponding algorithms and data structure tasks.


## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-class-labs.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the relevant week's folder.
3. Compile the C++ code:
    ```bash
    g++ your-file.cpp -o your-program
    ```
4. Run the program:
    ```bash
    ./your-program
    ```
